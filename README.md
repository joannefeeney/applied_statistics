## Project

My project code is in a file called `project.ipynb`.

In this project, I analyze the [PlantGrowth R dataset](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/PlantGrowth.csv).

The dataset contains two main variables, a treatment group and the weight of plants within those groups.

I perform t-tests and ANOVA on this dataset while describing the dataset and explaining my work.
I have successfully:

1. Downloaded and save the dataset to my repository.

2. Described the data set in the above notebook.

3. Described what a t-test is, how it works, and what my assumptions are.

3. Performed a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups `trt1` and `trt2`.

4. Performed ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups `ctrl`, `trt1`, and `trt2`.

5. Explained why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups.
